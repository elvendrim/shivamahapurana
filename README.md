# Śivamahāpurāṇa

The English translation of the _Śivamahāpurāṇa_, one of the eighteen major
_purāṇas_. This edition of the _Śivapurāṇa_ is based upon the 1906 manuscript
which contains seven sections (_saṃhitās_) and a total of 457 chapters
(_adhyayas_). However, the Purāṇa itself asserts to be a redaction of
an original text consisting of 12 _saṃhitās_ and 100,000 Sanskrit verses
(_ślokas_).
